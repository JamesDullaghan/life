# Life

Over the course of time and having hyperthymesia, I have run into so many different obstacles and industries that are required to learn as to not get hoodwinked.

This may not apply across the board and there may be differences between males and females but some of these chapters are applicable to all.

## Auto Insurance

Different levels of coverage

Usually coverage is presented in the form of Bodily/Accident/Property in the form of XX/XX/XX where XX is a dollar amount of coverage

Car insurance companies also provide a deductible amount for comprehensive and collision where your car and the other persons car is covered (property as well, see above).

Different plans, different levels of coverage, Covered California and Marketplace exchanges, etc.

### Legal System

The legal system is a mess designed to be punitive and make sure people don't reoffend. It's much better in the US than other systems but is still generally a good idea to avoid

#### Fighting Tickets

- If you use one of these services make sure the payment goes through to the court and is no longer active

#### Obtaining a lawyer

- Make sure to do due diligence on lawyers and if you end up in jail, try to have the number memorized and the bails
- There are services you can use like upcounsel that provide pretty good law advice considering the price
- Lawyers often times overcharge and leave you on the hook for the services they provide. Sometimes they provide very good and very thorough services but more often than not they are like housing contractors where they start a job and don't finish or provide advice that doesn't make sense and keep you on the hook asking for money each time you elicit a bit of feedback

#### Exercise rigorously after a breakup

  - Bodybuilding gym
  - Running to clear your mind

#### Self-respect

In order to maintain self-respect and respect of your peers, it's best you keep your head on straight and make sure not to day dream about the women of your past.

It's far more productive to focus on positive pursuits than to involve yourself with theatrics of people who no longer care about you.

It is never a good idea to take a break and if someone asks for a break the relationship is over. Move on.

Sometimes in relationships, people like to suck you back in to cause you problems and feel like they have the upper hand again, when in reality they are losing big time. Try to avoid this, as it's very obvious to other people what is happening and if it happens to you, try and be cognizant, even if you love the person, they are likely trying to cause you distress. People sometimes do not want other people doing well to succeed!

#### Move out rules if breaking up

- Make sure to document things
- Make sure to document ownership of things
- Keep separate bank accounts, phone accounts, etc.

## Working at a company

No idea, do not ask me. I have worked at small scale companies that have implemented and grown to hundred million dollar businesses and have worked shortly at really large companies which seem to produce no value, have very few a players and have no clear advise around dealing with companies.

**I do have some points:**

- If you work at a startup then work really hard, but do not sacrifice your entire life. Make sure the founders are really good people and if you're offered equity know that is can and may likely be worth nothing
- If you work at a large company, no clue. As an employee, figure out what your "superiors" are looking for
- If you encounter turbulence at large companies, know it's nothing to do with you, it's to do with people who have been with the company forever and have found ways to expedite their workday and hate when people come in and ruffle feathers
